          class="history"
        />
        Pokémon began as the hobby of Satoshi Tajiri, who as a child, enjoyed
        catching insects and tadpoles around a pond near his suburban Tokyo
        home. With the aid of Ken Sugimori among others, Tajiri formed Game
        Freak in order to give children the same thrill of imagination he
        enjoyed as a kid. Tajiri was also heavily influenced by a television
        show called Ultra Seven, wherein Ultraman would use huge monsters in
        capsules to help him fight evil. Therefore it was originally called
        Capsule Monsters, though Tajiri’s first few pitches to Nintendo failed.
        Later, with the help of Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo agreed to fund the
        project, though they still didn’t quite understand it, allowing the
        partners six years to prepare the first game. However, due to trademark
        issues Capsule Monsters was changed to Pocket Monsters, and Pokémon was
        born.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the creation of the original game, Satoshi Tajiri went to extreme
        lengths to see his dream fulfilled. With the help of artist and friend
        Ken Sugimori and composer Junichi Masuda, Game Freak built Pokémon Red
        and Green, with 150 creatures for players to catch, train, trade, and
        battle. However, the strain nearly drove Game Freak to bankruptcy with
        five employees quitting due to troubling financial conditions. As a
        result, Tajiri worked extremely long stints of unpaid hours during the
        creation of the first game. After debugging was finalised and the
        software complete, Shigeki Morimoto programmed the ultra-rare Mew into
        the game, although Game Freak planned to keep the 151st Pokémon a
        secret.

      <p>
        On February 27, 1996, Pokémon Red and Green Versions were released on
        the original Game Boy. Upon release, the game only saw modest sales,
        although, after players discovered Mew, the youth magazine CoroCoro
        announced a “Legendary Offer” to distribute Mew to twenty lucky winners.
        The contest saw 78,000 entrants and demand for the game soon
        skyrocketed. As a result, Pokémon Blue was released with enhanced
        graphics and sound. The Pokémon Trading Card Game was soon developed by
        Media Factory in October 1996. It contained an alternate set of rules
        and saw massive popularity upon release. CoroCoro also held many
        illustration contests for the cult card game. From this point, Pokémon
        continued to take over Japan, achieving unprecedented cultural status.

      <p>
        An anime series was born with the main character and trainer named
        Satoshi – after Satoshi Tajiri, though this was later changed in English
        to Ash Ketchum – with his rival named after Shigeru Miyamoto – later
        Gary Oakes in the English dubbed version. A manga was also made called
        The Electric Tale of Pikachu which became the first-ever Japanese anime
        translated into English. Furthermore, the term Gotta Catch ‘Em All was
        coined in conjunction with the film, Mewtwo Strikes Back, which briefly
        held the record for highest-grossing opening for an animated film when
        it aired in the US in 1999. Plus, the first-ever Pokémon Centre was
        opened in Tokyo which focused on merchandise and all other spin-offs.
